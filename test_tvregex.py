# Program will take command line arguments:
# -> File (required)
# -> -s / --silent = Fail silently if matching fails
# ----> Normal behaviour is to ask for show name
# Program uses regex to parse file name
# Program finds match for show name
# -> Needs some kind of writeable config file (JSON?)
# Program renames file with show name and episode number
# -> Can do date based if needed (i.e. Daily Show)
